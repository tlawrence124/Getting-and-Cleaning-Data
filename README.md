# This code reads in data from the test and train files and combines them into a matrix while also labeling them based on activity and subject
#It then calculates the means and standard deviations of each of the activities and each of the subject for the test and train data. 
#The means and standard deviations are then assembled into a data frame and written as a .txt file
